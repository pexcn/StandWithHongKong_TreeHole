Oh, to send a message back to any Mainland China anonymous people interested in HK and news from outside world. In American academia for 二千十九年十一月十三日、I did wear all black everything on campus and saw at least one other person in all black that day. It was for the #hkwearsblack day. 



I don't post selfies to protect my privacy and real-life identity where I can speak freely on Twitter, but it was the first "offline" thing I did related to HK, besides talking on the phone about HK with other Americans. I personally replied on Twitter to the one US representative voting against HKHRDA to say that, if the US govt turned our campuses into war zones, I would hope for the international community to protect Americans from our own government, trying to counter his excuse for voting against it.



I like East Asian cultures and am studying some Japanese and Kanji, but afraid of CCP if I tried to visit China and "asked too many questions" about history and religions in China- I am indeed interested but afraid to cross lines. I hope you can know you are not alone, I wish one day for the people of China to be able to freely share their culture online and talk with the world, without fear of any censor or wall.
