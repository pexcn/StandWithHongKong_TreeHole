  I think the people of HK cannot win their fight without the support of brave
  people on the Mainland. So we must show our respect, appreciation and support
  to our brothers and sisters on the Mainland who support freedom and HK.

Thank-you for this initiative.  I am HK born Chinese that grew up in Canada.  I hope that some day freedom and peace will be in every corner of China.  I think the people of HK cannot win their fight without the support of brave people on the Mainland.  So we must show our respect, appreciation and support to our brothers and sisters on the Mainland who support freedom and HK.
